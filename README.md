# Frogger - Smith College's CSC 111 Final Project

This is a recreation of the classic arcade game Frogger in Python using Zelle's [graphics library](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py). The player controls a frog whose objective is to navigate through obstacles to get to the other side of the street.

This is my final project of Introduction to Computer Science class at Smith College.

## How to run?

+ The main file is the ```frogger.py```. Just run it to play.
+ Will work on Python 3.7 and up.

## Sources for in-game sprites

+ [All game object sprites (frog, obstacles and pavements)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).
+ [The title](https://segaretro.org/Frogger).
+ [Trophy sprite](http://pixelartmaker.com/art/424e4e678fbdeb2) (modified by me using GIMP).
+ ["PLAY" sprite](http://pixelartmaker.com/art/e3f7b1a34392918) (modified by me using GIMP).
+ [Ghost sprite](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0822/1983/articles/ghost-witch-pixel-art-pixel-art-ghost-witch-witchery-spell-scary-pixel-8bit.png) (modified by me using GIMP).

## My ramble

+ I wanted to try Pygame but it was a little bit glitchy on my computer, plus I wanted to see how far I could go with Zelle's graphics (pretty far it turns out).
+ Not sure how it would look on a Mac really. The highscore screen might be a little bit screwed up.
